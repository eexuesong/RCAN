# RCAN

This repository is an updated and detailed version of repository [3D-RCAN](https://github.com/AiviaCommunity/3D-RCAN).

## System Requirements

- Windows 10. Linux and Mac OS should be able to run the code but the code has been only tested on Windows 10 so far.
- Python 3.7+
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0

Tested Environment:

- Windows 10
- Python 3.10
- NVIDIA RTX A5000 24 GB
- CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0

## Environment Configuration:
1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows).

2. Create a conda environment.
    - In Pycharm, create a new project named e.g. "CARE" using [Conda environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html). A new environment with same name will also be created.
    - Or in [Anaconda Prompt](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html), create a new environment named "CARE" by:
        ```posh
        conda create --name CARE python=3.10
        ```
        To see a list of all your environments, type:
        ```posh
        conda info --envs
        ```
        or:
        ```posh
        conda env list
        ```
        Then in Pycharm, create a new project named e.g. "CARE" using Conda environment.
        Select the location of the Conda environment we just created as:
        ```posh
        C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\anaconda3\envs\CARE
        ```

3. In Anaconda Prompt, activate the new environment:
    ```posh
    conda activate CARE
    ```

## Package Installation:
4. GPU setup
    
    Note: Important, or you will run DL on CPU instead. Without a GPU, training and prediction will be much slower (~30-60 times, even when using a computer with 40 CPU cores):
    
    - First install NVIDIA GPU driver if you have not.

    - For GPU support, it is very important to install the specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN that are compatible with the respective version of TensorFlow.
        
        Install the CUDA (11.2), cuDNN (8.1.0) ([Question about version selection?](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#gpu:)):
        ```posh
        conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
        ```

5. In Anaconda Promp, install [TensorFlow 2.10](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.10.0/):
    ```posh
    pip install tensorflow==2.10
    pip install numpy==1.26.4
    ```

6. In Anaconda Promp, verify the GPU setup:
    ```posh
    python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
    ```
    
7. Finally, install the latest stable version of the [CSBDeep](https://pypi.org/project/csbdeep/) package with pip.
    - If you installed TensorFlow 2 (version 2.x.x):
    ```posh
    pip install csbdeep
    ```
    - If you installed TensorFlow 1 (version 1.x.x):
    ```posh
    pip install "csbdeep[tf1]"
    ```
    - Besides csbdeep, numpy, tifffile, scipy and matplotlib will also be installed meanwhile.
    - Also install [scikit-image](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-image/) for image transform:
    ```posh
    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image
    ```
## Run Files:
8. Copy these files into the Pycharm project "CARE" folder and modify it accordingly.

9. Copy "[ImageJ_formatted_TIFF.m](https://github.com/eexuesong/ImageJ_format_tiff/blob/main/ImageJ_formatted_TIFF.m)" and "[Simple_IFD.m](https://github.com/eexuesong/ImageJ_format_tiff/blob/main/Simple_IFD.m)" from [ImageJ_format_tiff](https://github.com/eexuesong/ImageJ_format_tiff.git) repository.

10. Run code
     - In Pycharm, run the current file by Shift + F10
     - In Anaconda Prompt, run the Python file, e.g.:
     ```posh
     cd /D D:\Code\Python Code\CARE
     Python datagen_isotropic.py
     ```

11. Use ctrl-C in the Terminal to terminate the process.

12. Code run sequence: [datagen_isotropic.py](https://github.com/eexuesong/CARE/blob/main/datagen_isotropic.py) --> [training_3D.py](https://github.com/eexuesong/CARE/blob/main/training_3D.py) --> [prediction_isotropic_6degree.py](https://github.com/eexuesong/CARE/blob/main/prediction_isotropic_6degree.py)

## Notes:
 (1) Do the following before initializing TensorFlow to limit TensorFlow to first GPU:
 
    import os
    os.environ["CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER"]="PCI_BUS_ID"
    os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"

 (2) You can find out which version of TensorFlow is installed via:

    pip show tensorflow
